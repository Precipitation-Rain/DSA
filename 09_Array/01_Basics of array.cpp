// # array:

/*
# what is array:
1].list which contain so many elements of same type.
ex] 10000 integers/char/float

2]same type ke bahot sare elemnts store kar sakte hain.

3] they store on contiguous memory location.

4] we can access them with index


#why we need them:

if someone tell you make 10000 varaible to strore 10000 values ,imagine how hectic will we that.
to avoid this we introduce array where we can store as much element as we want in one varaible.
